What is da.gd?
==============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/relrod/dagd.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/relrod/dagd)

da.gd is both a URL shortener and a collection of quick-info tools written in PHP. It allows you to use `curl` (or any http client) to quickly retrieve various kinds of information from an easy-to-remember url.

The goal of this project is to just make an easy to use, little-of-everything tool that works on any device or in any script in any situation. So far, some interesting ideas have been requested (and implemented). If you have an idea for a feature you would like to see, please either (order of preference):

- Fork, Add feature, Send pull request for review/merge.
- Ask relrod on irc (freenode) via PM.
- File it in the issue tracker.

Because a goal of this project is to have it work for many purposes/situations, I encourage feedback, ideas, participation, and interaction with this project. Have some fun with it :)
